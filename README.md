# Libre Unified Naming Convention
LibreUNC, is an continuation of the older variation of the organization between executor developers to provide a unified scripting API for our scripters.

## Why Continue this?
As much as I am aware that [sUNC](https://sunc.su) exist, I believe there should be more FLOSS environment checks.
-# I understand the fact that there are going to people who try to fake the test, but this is primary as a fun project. 

## What would make this different from comeptitors
- Competitors lack community used functions such as:
    - `Actor` Library `getscriptfromthread`, `getactors`
    - `Input` Library
    - More functions related to Reflexion like `isnetworkowner`, `isclientobj` and other.
    - Miscellacious, yet useful functions like `setfflag`, `setfpscap`, `load_video_frame`
- Transparency and Open Sourced.
- No Logging
